# ProgrammingGrowth

This repository contains various codes for simulating the dynamics of cluster growth for different growth regulatory circuits. 

### System Requirements/Installation:
These codes were ran with MATLAB R2019a.

### Instructions for use:
The main script for simulating the dynamics is `Script_growthdynamics_nozeta_forcluster'. In this script, there is a section 'Define parameters' in which one can specify the various parameters of the model.
Running this script creates a MATLAB workspace containing the data of the simulation.

The file `Script_AnalyzeDynamicsData' can then be used to analyze and visualize the saved data.
